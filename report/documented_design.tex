% Chapter 2: Documented Design
%
% Required documentation for 'Documented Design'
% - The type of system that a student is developing will determine the aspects
%   of the system that need to be covered in documented design. It is anticipated
%   that for all systems, a high level overview of how different parts of the
%   system would interact would be usefull, this may be a:
%	- Structure / Heirarchy chart
%   - A system flowchart
%   - A data flow diagram, or object / class diagrams, accompanied by any further
%	  explaination that is helpful
%	- non-standard diagrams that combine elements of data flow and program
%	  control are accepted, as long as the two can be clearly distinguished
% - Students should also document how the important parts of their system work
%	Possible items that might be in design could be:
%	- Algorithms
%	- Data Structures
%	- File Structure and organisation
%	- Database design
%	- Queries
%	- Human Computer Interaction
%	- Hardware selection/design
